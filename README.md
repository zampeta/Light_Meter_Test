Light_Meter_Test
================

Just made 

The file ELm is the file sent by the Cambridge Research, i just changed the period and the # of samples. 
The idea goes like that if you have a screen of 60Hz (Period of 16 msec) then you need to sample at twice frequency, Nyquist frequency, so you need 120 Hz! 



The other way round,
16 msec Period -> 1 sample  -> 60 Hz
16 msec Period -> 2 samples -> 120 Hz

12 msec Period -> 10 samples -> 120 Hz
